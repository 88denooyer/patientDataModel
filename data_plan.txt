pAI developing Patient Model Groups

Beginning:
    Grouping Pain Tolerance
        Everyday Occurrence Pain:
            1. Migraine
                a. Stops activity for the day (debilitating)
                b. Need a break from activity to take Advil and recover
                c. No need to stop work, takes Advil
                d. No need for Advil, migraine will pass
            2. Closed a door or drawer on finger
                a. Definitely broken. End of the world. Head to the hospital
                b. Immobilizes finger for the day
                c. Take an Advil for the pain since it'll probably hurt later
                d. No Advil. That didn't even hurt. You should see the other guy
            3. Bee String (NOT ALLERGIC - IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC AND HAVE BEEN STUNG BY A BEE CONSULT A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY)
                a. Can't use this body part for the day, even after an anti-inflammatory (Benadryl + Advil)
                b. Benadryl and Advil plus some rest and the day will go on
                c. Benadryl for the reaction and some ice
                d. Ice and continue with the day
                e. What bee sting?
        Emergency / Rare Occurrence Pain (up to one week after surgery or injury):
            1. Wisdom teeth removal
                a. Regular prescription painkiller use and pain still causes sleep loss
                b. Painkiller use helped with eating and sleeping... still very painful
                c. Painkiller use just to sleep, Advil during the day
                d. No painkiller use a 1 day after surgery, Advil use throughout the day
                e. No painkiller use at all, Advil just to eat and sleep
            2. Broken bone - ignore immediate injury, consider after hospital visit (arm, leg, hand, etc.)
                a. Regular prescription painkiller use and pain still causes sleep loss
                b. Painkillers use just to sleep, Advil during the day
                c. No painkiller use 1-3 days after injury
                d. Advil just to help with sleep and daily activity
                e. No painkiller use at all, maybe use Advil to help sleep
    Grouping Flexibility
        Flexibility of uninjured appendage (assuming leg for now):
            1. Toe touch
                a. Hands reach knee
                b. Hands reach middle of shin
                c. Hands reach ankle
                d. Hands reach toes
                e. Palm on floor
            2. Knee bend
                a. Bending knee so foot is barely off ground
                b. Bending knee so angle of bend is ~45 degrees (form a right angle)
                c. Bending knee so you can reach back and grab foot
                d. Heel can touch to butt
        Flexibility of injured appendage (assuming leg for now):
            1. Toe touch
                a. Hands reach knee
                b. Hands reach middle of shin
                c. Hands reach ankle
                d. Hands reach toes
                e. Palm on floor
            2. Knee bend
                a. Bending knee so foot is barely off ground
                b. Bending knee so angle of bend is ~45 degrees (form a right angle)
                c. Bending knee so you can reach back and grab foot
                d. Heel can touch to butt

Middle:
    Grouping Activity
        Physical activity (highest amount of activity before the injury is assumed to have affected activity):
            1. Gym - heavy weight lifting
                a. 6-7 days / week
                b. 4-5 days / week
                c. 2-3 days / week
                d. once a week
                e. never

                d. once a week
                e. never
